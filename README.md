## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a readme generator that prompts the user to fill out the relevant fields that comprise a good readme. The app uses the inquirer package to capture the data input by the user and creates a ready-to-use readme.

Once the user fills out each form, the generated readme will be written to the JS folder.
