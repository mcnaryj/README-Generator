## README Generator!

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a readme generator that prompts the user to fill out the relevant fields that comprise a good readme. The app uses the inquirer package to capture the data input by the user and creates a ready-to-use readme.

## Installation

Download the files contained in the README-Generator repository, either through Github or by making a clone of the repository and downloading it locally. Once the file is downloaded, open it with VS Code or a similar code editor with node js installed. From there, install the node package modules via npm i, and then enter 'node index.js' in the command line.

## Usage

This application is intended for users who do not want to spend a lot of time preparing content in a readme.

## Tests

Install npm and select the assets/js directory. From there, run node index.js, which will initiate a series of prompts for the user to complete, pertaining to the relevant information contained in a "good" readme. Once the user fills out each form, the generated readme will be written to the JS folder.
